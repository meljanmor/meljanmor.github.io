    "text": "Hey there! Iâ€™m Melissa. I am an ecologist and environmental science researcher focused on advancing our understanding of ecological systems through fieldwork, data analysis, and scientific writing. My experience spans pollinator ecology, insect biology, and environmental data science, including safely leading field crews, conducting large-scale ecological surveys in U.S. national parks, and developed sampling and analysis methods. I bring skills in plot and transect surveys, flora and fauna identification, soil and water quality assessments, and grant and permit writing. I have coauthored peer-reviewed publications and technical reports that address species interactions, community dynamics, and ecosystem change.\nAs a problem solver in the office, field, and lab, I thrive in dynamic environments that require adaptability, collaboration, and creative solutions. I am eager to expand my skill set and connect with researchers dedicated to rigorous ecological research and effective science communication. ## Education\nColorado State University (CSU) | Fort Collins, CO M.S. in Ecology | Dec 2025\nMoravian College | Bethlehem, PA B.S. in Environmental Science | May 2021"
