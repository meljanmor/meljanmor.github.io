My work spans pollinator ecology, insect biology, and environmental data science, with experience leading international field crews, conducting ecological surveys in U.S. national parks, and developing innovative sampling and analysis methods. I bring practical expertise in transects, flora and fauna identification, soil analysis, and limnology assessments, along with strong skills in grant and permit writing. I have contributed to peer-reviewed publications and technical reports that advance our understanding of species interactions, community dynamics, and ecosystem change.\n\n# I am a problem solver in the office, field, and lab—motivated to learn quickly, adapt to challenges, and apply my skills in diverse ecological contexts. I’m looking to connect with researchers and collaborators dedicated to rigorous ecological fieldwork, cross-disciplinary research, and the clear communication of science through writing and publication."
