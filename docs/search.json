I am an ecologist and environmental science researcher passionate about investigating ecological systems through field-based research, data-driven analysis, and scientific writing. My work spans pollinator ecology, insect biology, and environmental data science, with experience leading international field crews, conducting ecological surveys in U.S. national parks, and developing innovative sampling and analysis methods. I bring practical expertise in transects, flora and fauna identification, soil analysis, and limnology assessments, along with strong skills in grant and permit writing. I have contributed to peer-reviewed publications and technical reports that advance our understanding of species interactions, community dynamics, and ecosystem change. ## Education\nColorado State University (CSU) | Fort Collins, CO M.S. in Ecology | Dec 2025\nMoravian College | Bethlehem, PA B.S. in Environmental Science | May 2021"
