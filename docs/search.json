    "text": "Hey there! I’m Melissa. I am an ecologist and environmental science researcher focused on advancing our understanding of ecological systems through fieldwork, data analysis, and scientific writing. My experience spans pollinator ecology, insect biology, and environmental data science, including safely leading field crews, conducting large-scale ecological surveys in U.S. national parks, and developed sampling and analysis methods. I bring skills in plot and transect surveys, flora and fauna identification, soil and water quality assessments, and grant and permit writing. I have coauthored peer-reviewed publications and technical reports that address species interactions, community dynamics, and ecosystem change.\nAs a problem solver in the office, field, and lab, I thrive in dynamic environments that require adaptability, collaboration, and creative solutions. I am eager to expand my skill set and connect with researchers dedicated to rigorous ecological research and effective science communication."

    "text": "I’m originally from New York City, though my curiosity about the natural world truly flourished after my family moved to the Poconos. Long hikes in state parks, observing wildlife, and volunteering at events like BioBlitzes sparked a passion for exploring ecosystems and understanding how humans interact with the environment. Early experiences with the National Park Service at Delaware Water Gap helped me build skills in science communication and public engagement, setting the foundation for my career in ecology.\n\n\nMy academic and professional path has taken me from Northampton Community College to earning a B.S. in Environmental Science at Moravian College, and now to graduate research at Colorado State University. I’ve led international field crews, conducted insect surveys, and developed innovative sampling and analysis methods. My work has allowed me to hone practical field and lab techniques, navigate complex ecological research projects, and contribute to both scientific publications and community-focused initiatives, including drafting a Local Climate Action Plan for Upper Darby Township.\nOutside of research, I love hiking, paddling, and camping, as well as exploring museums, listening to vinyls, going to theatres, and reading. Whether in the field, lab, or office, I’m energized by problem-solving, collaboration, and discovering ways to connect people with the natural world."

This internship allowed me to interact with students from my teacher assistantship, Climate Negotiation course at Moravian College, and connect them to the YEAH network. The YEAH Network is working on a project that brings students together from several universities: Moravian College, Boston University, Michigan Tech University, Colorado College, Indiana University, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of Connecticut, University of Derby (UK), Vanderbilt University, La Molina University (Peru) and Monash University (Australia). Students were placed into teams that represent the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s). Each team had a fellow, and I was a fellow for SDG #4, which focuses on quality education. Each team did research into the SDG’s target goals to help create a case study. This fellowship allowed me to exercise my leadership and science communication skills. I learned about complex global environmental issues, climate advocacy, policies (local, federal, national), the United Nations, human rights, and gender issues through multicultural perspectives.\n●       Spring Cohort for Upper Darby Township: January 2021 – May 2021\nThrough ICLEI- Local Governments for Sustainability, I helped Upper Darby township complete their greenhouse gas inventory and draft a Climate Action Plan (CAP) that incorporates a climate justice plan. Upper Darby is very diverse in its population and this experience has allowed me to further explore my interest in social equity as well as climate change. This experience required me to engage with stakeholders, the Mayor of Upper Darby, the Deputy Chief Administrative Officer, and the community (via online surveys) as part of the development of the climate action plan. Clearpath (emissions management software suite from ICLEI-USA) was used to review inventory and forecast emissions. Social justice, adaptation, mitigation, vulnerability assessments, and monitoring all played a major role in drafting the climate action plan.
