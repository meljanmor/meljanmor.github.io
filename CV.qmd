## **Academic Experience**

●       **Youth Environmental Alliance in Higher Education:** August 2020 – May 2021

The Youth Environmental Alliance in Higher Education Network (YEAH) is grant funded through the National Science Foundation. This internship allowed me to interact with students from my teacher assistantship, Climate Negotiation course at Moravian College, and connect them to the YEAH network. The YEAH Network is working on a project that brings students together from several universities: Moravian College, Boston University, Michigan Tech University, Colorado College, Indiana University, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of Connecticut, University of Derby (UK), Vanderbilt University, La Molina University (Peru) and Monash University (Australia). Students were placed into teams that represent the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s). Each team had a fellow, and I was a fellow for SDG #4, which focuses on quality education. Each team did research into the SDG’s target goals to help create a case study. This fellowship allowed me to exercise my leadership and science communication skills. I learned about complex global environmental issues, climate advocacy, policies (local, federal, national), the United Nations, human rights, and gender issues through multicultural perspectives.

●       **Spring Cohort for Upper Darby Township:** January 2021 – May 2021

Through ICLEI- Local Governments for Sustainability, I helped Upper Darby township complete their greenhouse gas inventory and draft a Climate Action Plan (CAP) that incorporates a climate justice plan. Upper Darby is very diverse in its population and this experience has allowed me to further explore my interest in social equity as well as climate change. This experience required me to engage with stakeholders, the Mayor of Upper Darby, the Deputy Chief Administrative Officer, and the community (via online surveys) as part of the development of the climate action plan. Clearpath (emissions management software suite from ICLEI-USA) was used to review inventory and forecast emissions. Social justice, adaptation, mitigation, vulnerability assessments, and monitoring all played a major role in drafting the climate action plan. Adobe Photoshop and Canva were used to make infographics for community engagement.
