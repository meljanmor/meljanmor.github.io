Hey there! I'm Melissa -- an ecologist and environmental science researcher dedicated to improving our understanding of ecological systems through fieldwork, data analysis, and science communication. My experience spans pollinator ecology, community ecology, and environmental data science, including safely leading and training field crews, conducting large-scale ecological surveys across U.S. national parks, and developing sampling and analysis protocols to support research and resource management. I bring skills in plot and transect surveys, flora and fauna identification, and successful permit and grant support for research initiatives. I also have experience in STEM education and community outreach, communicating science to diverse audiences, mentoring students in field and lab techniques, and developing materials that foster environmental literacy. I have coauthored [peer-reviewed publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=list_works&gmla=AKzYXQ2_VBRUnWQ-jBUhwuivrRBTBWTz1pOkZYncq8-iwj3Cg1mcKx6j6DUyEyw4iE8kGfQSLq2enKGvxArSvw&user=GzcdEKwAAAAJ) and technical reports that explore species interactions, behavioral and community dynamics, and the ways environmental change influences ecological processes.

As a problem solver in the office, field, and lab, I thrive in dynamic environments that require adaptability, collaboration, and creative solutions. I am committed to expanding my skill set and connecting with researchers dedicated to rigorous ecological research and effective science communication.
